<p class="first-p">
  <span class="first-word">I decided</span> to collect a list of books that I really enjoyed and that at some point I wished
I had known them sooner. I hope that you enjoy them as much as I did.
</p>

## General topics

<br>
The story of a 9 year old girl (Liesel) that lost her home and her family in a period of time where whole germany was holding by
a thread (1939). Even though Liesel parents have been taken to a concentration camp, she finds a new family that has

<span class="book-description">
**Girl, woman, other** _Bernardine Evaristo (2020)_
<br>
A book with a collection of stories about women living in the UK. I really enjoyed reading all of those  stories that we
sometimes might sometimes overlook. I particularly liked the end. I was not expecting it, although maybe I should have ...
This book made me reflect about many things as I read the stories of struggle of many people, it is probably one of those 
few books that I would read twice.

<span class="book-cover">

</span>
<span class="book-description">
**Invisible women** _Caroline Criado Perez (2020)_
<br>
As a man reading this book, I have to admit that after reading it I realized that I might have a lot more prejudices in my head that I am proud to admit. This 
book covers a wide range of topics including government policies, medical research, workplace, social media, etc. It brings
across a large amount of case studies and stories that illustrate how in many cases women have been forgotten in a world
where they play such a big role. This books seems for some to be a controversial,
but I believe that if it has paved the way to this kind of discussion, then it has achieved the purpose for what it was written.

</span>
<span class="book-description">
**Behave** _Robert M. Sapolsky (2018)_
<br>
If you are someone that enjoys reading about why people do what they do and the science behind it, then you will definitely
like this book. I have to admit that it cna get very technical in some parts, but it is generally in parts that are more 
or less optional. This books tries to address the general question of "**Why do we do what we do?**", going through the
biological response of the human body that makes us do or not do something.
</span>

## Mystery & Thriller
<span class="book-cover">
<img alt="Cover" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/book-covers/the-institute.jpeg">
</span>
<span class="book-description">
**The institute** _Stephen King (2019)_
<br>
Definitely a book that got my attention from the first chapter. I was a little hesitant to buy it at first but I have 
to say that I do not regret it, not even a bit. This book took me in a story from Minneapolis tu DuPray and all the way
to a mysterious institute located in the forest outside a small town. Whatever you think this institute does, I am sure 
the story will keep you reading.

<span class="book-cover">
<img alt="Cover" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/book-covers/doctor-sleep.jpeg">
</span>
<span class="book-description">
**Doctor sleep** _Stephen King (2013)_
<br>
I have to admit that the description of the book that you probably read in the back cover does not make justice to the 
story that awaits you. The story might take a couple of chapters to really drag you in, but once it does (and it does),
it really is worth the wait. For those who have read **The Shining** from _Stephen King_, you will probably see a teaser 
in the cover art of the book (back cover), but no spoilers!

</span>
<span class="book-description">
**The starless sea** _Erin Morgenstern (2020)_
<br>
It is always difficult to choose a "_favourite book_", but I believe this is my favourite book at the moment. It all 
starts when our main character Zachary checks a strange book at the university library. A book with peculiar stories and tales
of strange places and people. This is a story that made me feel as if I was the one racing down labyrinths. And as the 
book says: "_This is the home of storytellers, story-lovers and those who will protect our stories at al costs_".

<span class="book-cover">
<img alt="Cover" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/book-covers/the-night-circus.jpeg">
</span>
<span class="book-description">
**The night circus** _Erin Morgenstern (2012)_
<br>
As I read **The starless sea** form the same author, I became curios about what other magnificent stories could I have 
missed. That is how I came across **THe night circus**, the story of a mysterious circus that arrives into town without 
a warning. It simply appears from one day to the other, and just as it arrived, it disappears to move on to the next town.
But the means of travel of this circus is by far the least wonder of this story, what truly amazed me was what was 
happening behind the scenes. A secret "battle" between two people that have never met, and yet they are determined to be
the last one standing.
