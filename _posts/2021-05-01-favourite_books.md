This is a collection of books that I really enjoyed and that at some point I wished
I had known them sooner. I hope that you enjoy them as much as I did.

If you are someone that enjoys reading about why people do what they do and the science behind it, then you will definitely like this book. I have to admit that it cna get very technical in some parts, but it is generally in parts that are more or less optional. This books tries to address the general question of "**Why do we do what we do?**", going through the biological response of the human body that makes us do or not do something.

#### The book thief
The story of a 9 year old girl (Liesel) that lost her home and her family in a period of time where whole germany was holding by
a thread (1939). Even though Liesel parents have been taken to a concentration camp, she finds a new family that has 
adopted her as her own daughter. Meanwhile, Liesel struggles to something in her life to hang on to. This is how she 
starts stealing books and learning to read by writing in the walls of the basement. This is her story, the story of how
in the most terrible of times you can find hope.

#### Invisible woman
As a man reading this book, I have to admit that after reading it I realized that I might have a lot more prejudices in my head that I am proud to admit. This 
book covers a wide range of topics including government policies, medical research, workplace, social media, etc. It brings
across a large amount of case studies and stories that illustrate how in many cases women have been forgotten in a world
where they play such a big role. This books seems for some to be a controversial,
but I believe that if it has paved the way to this kind of discussion, then it has achieved the purpose for what it was written.

#### Girls, woman, other
A book with a collection of stories about women living in the UK. I really enjoyed reading all of those  stories that we
sometimes might sometimes overlook. I particularly liked the end. I was not expecting it, although maybe I should have ...
This book made me reflect about many things as I read the stories of struggle of many people, it is probably one of those 
few books that I would read twice.

#### My sister's keeper
This is the story of a family facing a great challenge. The story surrounds two sisters, Kate faces a rare illness that 
has a very low survival rate, and Kate who has undergone several medical treatments to help her sister. 
However, Anna's willingness to help might cost her a lot more than she is willing to give up in her life. The book tells 
the story of this family, seen from several perspectives, but all leading to a similar conclusion: _there is no right answer._

#### A long way down
On New Year's Eve, four people meet at the top of a skyscraper in New York. The events that lead to them coming here are 
very different, but one thing is clear to all of them, they all came here to commit suicide. This novel by Nick Hornby 
contains a lot more comedy than I would have expected and the story unravels quite fast, making it very interesting.

#### Imaginary friend
Probably one of the few books I have read completely in under one week. The story really gets you within the first chapters. 
It starts with the disappearance of a small kids in the woods around a small town. Nobody can find him and just as everyone 
was giving up on him, he appears with not even a scratch on him. He can not remember anything from the days he was lost in the woods.
All he can remember is being helped by "the good man". 

#### The institute
Definitely a book that got my attention from the first chapter. I was a little hesitant to buy it at first but I have 
to say that I do not regret it, not even a bit. This book took me in a story from Minneapolis tu DuPray and all the way
to a mysterious institute located in the forest outside a small town. Whatever you think this institute does, I am sure 
the story will keep you reading. 

#### Doctor sleep
I have to admit that the description of the book that you probably read in the back cover does not make justice to the 
story that awaits you. The story might take a couple of chapters to really drag you in, but once it does (and it does),
it really is worth the wait. For those who have read **The Shining** from _Stephen King_, you will probably see a teaser 
in the cover art of the book (back cover), but no spoilers!

#### The starless sea
It is always difficult to choose a "_favourite book_", but I believe this is my favourite book at the moment. It all 
starts when our main character Zachary checks a strange book at the university library. A book with peculiar stories and tales
of strange places and people. This is a story that made me feel as if I was the one racing down labyrinths. And as the 
book says: "_This is the home of storytellers, story-lovers and those who will protect our stories at al costs_".

#### The night circus
As I read **The starless sea** form the same author, I became curios about what other magnificent stories could I have 
missed. That is how I came across **THe night circus**, the story of a mysterious circus that arrives into town without 
a warning. It simply appears from one day to the other, and just as it arrived, it disappears to move on to the next town.
But the means of travel of this circus is by far the least wonder of this story, what truly amazed me was what was 
happening behind the scenes. A secret "battle" between two people that have never met, and yet they are determined to be
the last one standing.

#### Mr. Mercedes / Finders Keepers / End of Watch
This is an amazing series of 3 books. The story in the third book is connected to the third one but it is not connected 
to the second one, although the same trio of "detectives" features on each book. The first book starts with a maniac that
kills a lot of people with a car. Hodges is the detective in charge of that case but has to retire before being able to solve it. 
But the killer is not done yet, not by far. The second book jumps to another story related to a bunch of books that have been stolen 
by a mad man from a famous and reclusive writer. The third book continues the story from the first one. Where the same killer is
now back but with some peculiar and very dangerous brand new abilities.
